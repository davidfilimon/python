Curve Animator: Bezier and B-Spline Visualizer
Overview
Welcome to Curve Animator, a powerful and intuitive desktop application built with Python, PySide6, Matplotlib, and NumPy, designed to visualize Bezier and B-Spline curves. This application provides an interactive platform to understand how these fundamental computer graphics curves are constructed based on control points. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just curious about computational geometry, Curve Animator offers a clear and animated insight into these fascinating mathematical concepts.

Features
Interactive Control Point Management: Easily add and reset control points manually or import them from a file.
Multiple Bezier Curve Types:
Quadratic Bezier: Visualize curves defined by 3 control points.
Cubic Bezier: Explore curves shaped by 4 control points.
General Bezier: Understand how Bezier curves are constructed with an arbitrary number of control points using the de Casteljau's algorithm (or its equivalent sum formula).
B-Spline Curve Visualization: Generate and animate B-Spline curves, showcasing their local control property and smoothness.
Real-time Animation: Observe the dynamic construction of curves as t varies from 0 to 1, providing a vivid understanding of their parametric nature.
Clear Visualizations: Matplotlib integration ensures high-quality plots of control points and the resulting curves.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and easy-to-navigate interface built with PySide6.
File Import: Load control points from a text file (e.g., points.txt) for quick setup and experimentation.
Why Use Curve Animator?
Educational Tool: Perfect for students learning about computer graphics, computational geometry, or numerical methods.
Quick Experimentation: Rapidly test different sets of control points and observe their impact on curve shapes.
Visual Understanding: Go beyond static images and truly grasp the dynamic process of curve generation.

Installation
To run this application, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

PySide6
matplotlib
numpy
scipy
You can install them using pip:

Bash

pip install PySide6 matplotlib numpy scipy
Usage
Run the application:

Bash

python main.py
(Assuming your main application file is named main.py and it imports the other classes)

Navigate: Use the "Home," "Bezier," and "B-Spline" buttons to switch between sections.

Add Points:

On the Bezier or B-Spline pages, you can manually enter coordinates (e.g., 10,20) into the input field and click "Add Point".
Alternatively, click "Import from File" to load points from a text file, with each line containing x,y coordinates.
Select Bezier Type (Bezier Page only): Choose "Quadratic," "Cubic," or "General" from the dropdown menu to specify the type of Bezier curve you want to animate.

Draw/Animate: Click the "Draw" button to start the animation of the selected curve type with the currently defined control points.

Reset: Click "Reset" to clear all control points and the displayed curve.

Code Structure
main.py: The main application file, handling the PySide6 UI and integrating the animation classes.
bezier_animation.py: Contains the BezierAnimation class, responsible for calculating and animating Bezier curves (quadratic, cubic, and general).
bspline_animation.py: Contains the BSplineAnimation class, handling the calculation and animation of B-Spline curves.
ui_Calcul_Numeric.py: (Assumed to be generated by pyside6-uic) Defines the UI elements for the application.
